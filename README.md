# Invoice Information Extraction using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to automate the extraction of key information from invoice images, specifically focusing on the detection and localization of stamps and signatures. It employs a deep learning approach using the RetinaNet model, a state-of-the-art object detection architecture. By accurately identifying these elements, the project streamlines invoice processing and facilitates information retrieval for various applications.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a custom dataset of invoice images and corresponding annotations. Each image is accompanied by a JSON file containing bounding box coordinates for stamps and signatures. The dataset is preprocessed and transformed to prepare it for training and evaluation of the deep learning model.

## Model

The core of the project is the RetinaNet model, implemented using the PyTorch deep learning framework. RetinaNet is chosen for its efficiency and accuracy in object detection tasks. The model is trained on the invoice dataset, fine-tuning its parameters to achieve optimal performance in identifying stamps and signatures.

## Training and Evaluation

The project includes a training script  that handles model training, validation, and checkpointing. During training, the model learns to recognize patterns and features associated with stamps and signatures in invoices. Evaluation is performed using a separate script  to assess the model's performance on a held-out test dataset. Metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP) are used to quantify the accuracy of detections.

## Detection

The trained model can be used to detect stamps and signatures in new invoice images. The detection script provides functionality for loading the model, processing images, and visualizing the detected elements. Bounding boxes are drawn around the identified stamps and signatures, allowing users to locate and extract these key information pieces quickly.

## Tools and Technologies
